## Problem Summary

- Each army has 5 platoons (with types and soldier count).
- Types include: `Militia`, `Spearmen`, `LightCavalry`, `HeavyCavalry`, `FootArcher`, `CavalryArcher`.
- Some types have **class advantage** over others (e.g., Spearmen > Cavalry).
- If you have an advantage, each of your soldiers count as 2.
- If your soldier count is greater, you win the duel.
